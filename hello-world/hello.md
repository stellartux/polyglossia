# hello-world

A selection of polyglot scripts which say "Hello from $LANG!" in different
combinations of languages. They show the comment escaping tricks needed to
combine the languages, and definitions for `print/println/puts`, as a starting
point for unifying output between the languages.

## Colour Scheme
